Crude Oil Price Prediction - Georgios Tsoupras
Welcome to the Crude Oil Price Prediction repository! This repository contains the source code and data used in my thesis, where I analyze and predict crude oil prices using various machine learning models like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost.

Quick Overview
This repository includes:

Code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
Scripts to reproduce the predictions and visualizations found in the thesis.
A detailed guide on how to set up and run the project.
To get started, please refer to the detailed README file where you'll find instructions on:

How to set up your environment
How to run the code
An explanation of the models and dataset used
Links to additional resources
If you encounter any issues or would like to view the results without running the code, a PDF of the code and results is also provided in the repository.

Feel free to explore the code, and don't hesitate to leave comments, suggestions, or questions under the "Issues" or "Discussions" tabs.
